"Fake promises are being used without babel-jest. All promises created implicitly with async-await syntax will not be converted to fake promises. Fake promises may work with transpiler plugins that compile from async-await syntax to syntax that uses explicit ES6 Promises. However, these are outside the scope of the jest project, and have not been tested against.
